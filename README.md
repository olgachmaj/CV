## About
I am a enthusiastic, deliberate and perserverant Software Engineer in training who loves to create and to solve problems.

I take a great pleasure in self improvement and aim to expand my perspective through new experiences and learning about different technologies.

I have discovered coding when I learned basics of JavaScript and HTML at the age of ten, and been enthusiastic about tech ever since. 

## Background

After spending two years on self-driven learing to improve my language skills while working 
as a Tourist Guide, I have made a decision of moving away from my home country.

In role of a Care Assistant I have shown ability to quickly adapt and solve problems in various,
often challenging settings while maintaining profesional level of dementia care.

Working in a care sector has allowed me to develop communication & time management skills
which prove helpful when maintaining and writing code with others and independently.
