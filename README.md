##About
I am a enthusiastic, deliberate and perserverant Software Engineer in training who loves to create and to solve problems.

##Background

After spending two years on self-driven learing to improve my language skills while working 
as a Tourist Guide, I have made decision of moving away from my home country.

In role of a care assistant I have shown ability to quickly adapt and solve problems in various,
often challenging settings while maintaining profesional level of dementia care.

Working in a care sector has allowed me to develop my communication & time management skills
which prove helpful when maintaining and writing code with others and independently.
